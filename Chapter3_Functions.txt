**Switch Statements** pg 37
Switch statements by their nature are larger than one block or function, and
also its hard to make a switch statement that does one thing;
if we have to use a switch statement we should make sure that each switch 
statement is buried in a low level class and is never repeated. we do this with
polymorphism. 
(N) how implement a switch statement in clean way? how to make sure we did it
in the right way? 
TODO: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
TODO: Open Closed Principle (OCP)
the soloution to this problem is to bury the switch statement in the basement
of an Abstract Factory, and never let anyone see it again.
the general rule for switch is they can be tolerated if they appear only once,
are used to create polymorphic objects, and  are hidden behind an inheritanc 
relationship so that the rest of system can't see it.

**Use Descriptive Names**
in function names, better name describes what the function does.
